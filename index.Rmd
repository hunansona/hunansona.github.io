I grew up in the second largest city of Armenia, Gyumri. I obtained Bachelor degree in Informatics and Applied Mathematics from Yerevan State University, Armenia. Afterwards, I received Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics from EPFL and gained further experience while working in Nuclear power plant in Goesgen. Since March 1st, I am enrolled in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics PhD program under the supervision of PD Dr. Malgorzata Roos.
